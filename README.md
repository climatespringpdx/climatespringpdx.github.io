This spring (2022), the Climate Spring Collective is hosting Climate Spring, a month-long, citywide festival celebrating the climate that sustains us and the movement to sustain our climate.

We are kicking off Climate Spring with a 2-day celebration in a public park in Portland (TBA). In conjunction with the May 20th city-wide climate strike walkout, this celebration will feature bands, poets, speakers, games, workshops, discussions, art making, and other activities. We are inviting organizations and collectives that are working on climate issues to table and to host activities at this kickoff celebration to raise awareness of their efforts and invite people into their important work. 

Participating organizations and collectives will also host events throughout Climate Spring (May 22-June 21), such as classes, workshops, rallies, marches, dance parties, climate celebrations, and more. These events will be featured on Oregon Climate Hub, a new, comprehensive online resource for climate events in Oregon. Additionally, the Climate Spring Collective will provide consultation, publicity (on our website), and other support to ensure recognition of participating organizations and the success of Climate Spring events. 

Our hope is that by creating diverse ways to participate in climate action, we can help more and more people find their sense of belonging in the emerging, intergenerational climate movement. In this way, we can grow a climate movement that is more engaged, resourced, inclusive, visible, and connective. 

This spring, the movement blossoms.
